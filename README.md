# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, created as a submission for the FestX WebX competition. This project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information.

## Technologies and Tools

- **React**: For building the frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload whenever you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
