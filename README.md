## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload whenever you make changes.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
